## Build from Source
1. Building proteus-java requires installation of the [Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) compiler. Proteus requires Protobuf 3.4.x or higher.

    For Mac users you can easily install the Protobuf compiler using Homebrew:

        $ brew install protobuf

    For other operating systems you can install the Protobuf compiler using the pre-built packages hosted on the [Protobuf Releases](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) page.

2. Run the following Gradle command to build the project:

        $ ./gradlew clean build
